# Thesis project directly taken from AR Foundation
This project (Newton's laws in AR) was developed as a part of my master's thesis in DTU. The app is free for anyone to use-extent.
The project was developed with Unity 2018.3 and requires the ARFoundation package from the package manager.
It can be build directly through Unity to an AR-compatible Android or iOS device.
